# Flight Reservation

Simple POC Spring Boot Application for:

* Add new Flights(admin permission only).
* Finding flight.
* Booking a flight.
* Displaying Flights.
* Completing the reservation and emailing the  
  itinerary.
* Exposing the check-in feature as a service to be used by another micro-service([flightcheckin](https://github.com/ahmadmazen/flightcheckin) specialized for that function.
